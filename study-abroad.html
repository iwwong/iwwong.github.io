            <p class="process-analysis">I made sure to include a combination of pre-recorded images and videos as well as images and videos that I would be recording in real time so the stories would be more interesting. I also made an effort to include some fun (and relevant) snapchat features like stickers and filters.</p>

              <p class="process-analysis">
                Since the SFU Snapchat account already had an established audience that would be viewing our takeover, I wanted to inform the Study Abroad social media followers about this as well. Although this takeover was mainly meant for students that may not have known about studying abroad, I also wanted our own followers to get to know our office, the staff and the study abroad experiences of other students.
              </p>
              <p class="process-analysis">Using images that we've received from students that have studied abroad, I made some promotions that were posted sporadically on the Study Abroad Facebook, Twitter and Instagram before the takeover to generate some buzz.</p>

              <p class="process-analysis">
                The challenge with this campaign was that there was a combination of pre-recorded posts and real-time recorded posts. This meant that on top of assigning specific times for posting each post, I also had to run to different areas of the campus to record study abroad information sessions that were happening to post as well. I had to stay on top of all my upcoming posts while taking care of my responsibilities as the Design & Marketing Coordinator as well. Even though I planned things out to a tee, once the takeover began, I realized that there are so many variables involved that could push me off schedule and the posts I wanted to create in real time might not look exactly as planned. I had to do some quick thinking/problem solving in that situation to get the best outcome.

              <h5 class="process-title">REFLECTION</h5>
              <p class="process-analysis">
                Adaptability was really important for this task. Prior to this, I had never done a Snapchat takeover before, so I had to figure out the most effective ways to appeal to a large audience. Time also tried to catch up to me many times during the campaign so time management was essential. In the end, the campaign was very successful, each post was viewed by around 1,500 people and the organizers wanted to set aside more days for the Study Abroad office to takeover their Snapchat again.
